*The Elder Futhark rune Elhaz (also known as Algiz) symbolizes protection, defense, and connection with the divine or higher realms. It represents a warding off of evil and negative influences and an invitation for support from protective spirits.*

Here’s how you can enact Elhaz in your day-to-day life:

## Develop Personal Shields

Focus on building mental and emotional resilience to protect yourself from negative influences. Techniques include mindfulness, positive affirmations, and practices where you imagine a shield around you deflecting negativity.

## Enhance Physical Security

Take practical steps to improve the security of your personal space, such as your home or vehicle. This could involve updating locks, installing security systems, or simply ensuring your environment is safe and secure.

## Spiritual Practices

Engage in spiritual practices that call upon protective energies. This might include prayer, working with protective deities or spirits, or performing rituals that invoke protection.

## Wear Symbols of Protection

Wear or carry items that symbolize protection, such as jewelry featuring the Elhaz rune. These symbols can serve as a reminder of your protective intentions and help manifest a safe environment around you.

## Promote Positive Relationships

Foster relationships that are supportive and positive. Surround yourself with people who uplift and encourage you, and avoid those who drain your energy or bring negativity into your life.

## Cultivate Protective Gardening

Grow plants traditionally known for their protective qualities, such as thorny bushes near windows or herbs like rosemary and sage, often associated with protection and cleansing.

## Volunteer for Others’ Protection

Extend protection to others by volunteering for community safety programs, advocating for those who are vulnerable, or supporting organizations that focus on protection and defense of rights.
