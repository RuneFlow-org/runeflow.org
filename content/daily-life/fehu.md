*The Elder Futhark rune Fehu can be enacted in physical day-to-day life in various ways due to its associations with wealth, abundance, and prosperity.*

Here are a few ideas on how you might incorporate the energy and symbolism of Fehu into your daily life:

## Financial Mindfulness

Fehu relates to wealth and material success. Daily practices such as reviewing finances, budgeting, or planning investments can draw upon Fehu’s energy. Think of it as nurturing your resources wisely to grow.

## Making Money by Selling 

Incorporating the act of selling into your daily life as a reflection of the rune Fehu can transform a simple economic activity into a profound spiritual and personal growth experience. By understanding and embracing the deeper meanings behind Fehu, selling becomes more than just a way to make money—it becomes a path to creating and circulating abundance in its many forms.

## Gratitude for Abundance

Start or end your day with a gratitude practice where you focus on the abundance already present in your life. This could be anything from having a home, food, good health, or loving relationships. Recognizing and appreciating what you have can resonate with the essence of Fehu.

## Charitable Actions

Since Fehu also deals with the flow of wealth, engaging in acts of giving can embody this rune. Donating to charity, volunteering in community service, or even small acts of generosity like paying for someone’s meal can reflect Fehu's attributes.

## Decor and Symbols

Incorporate the Fehu rune in your home or workspace decor. You might place a rune stave of Fehu where you handle your financial matters or craft a piece of art or jewelry that features the rune to keep its energy close.

## Professional Development

Investing in your own skills and career can be a form of enacting Fehu. Whether taking courses, reading books related to your field, or networking to find new opportunities, these activities can help cultivate personal growth and potential financial rewards.

## Mindful Consumption

Reflect on your spending habits in light of Fehu's association with prosperity. Being conscious about where you invest your money - opting for quality over quantity, supporting ethical businesses, or buying local - can be a manifestation of the wise management of resources that Fehu encourages.
