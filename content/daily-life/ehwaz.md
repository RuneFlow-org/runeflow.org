*The Elder Futhark rune Ehwaz symbolizes the horse, representing trust, partnership, movement, and progress. It emphasizes the relationships we form and the journeys we undertake, both physically and metaphorically.*

Hereâ€™s how you can enact Ehwaz in your day-to-day life:

## Strengthen Partnerships

Focus on building and maintaining strong partnerships, whether they are personal, professional, or communal. This involves trust, mutual respect, and working together towards common goals, mirroring the relationship between a horse and its rider.

## Embrace Change and Progress

Be open to change and actively pursue opportunities for personal and professional growth. Like a horse moving forward, use Ehwaz as a reminder not to stay stagnant but to progress and evolve.

## Travel and Exploration

Engage in physical travel and exploration to experience new cultures, ideas, and environments. This aligns with Ehwaz's theme of movement and journeying, broadening your perspective and understanding.

## Physical Fitness and Activity

Maintain your physical health through activities that involve movement, such as riding, cycling, running, or hiking. These activities improve physical fitness and symbolize the dynamic energy of Ehwaz.

## Develop Reliability

Work on being reliable and trustworthy in all aspects of life. Consistency and dependability in your actions will strengthen your relationships and enhance your reputation, reflecting the trustworthiness of a steadfast horse.

## Collaborative Projects

Engage in projects or activities that require teamwork and collaboration. Working effectively with others can lead to successful outcomes and foster a spirit of unity and partnership.

## Animal Care and Connection

If possible, spend time with animals, particularly horses, to cultivate a connection that teaches mutual respect and care. Learning to communicate and care for animals can deepen your understanding of non-verbal communication and empathy.

## Support Mobility and Access

Advocate for or contribute to causes that promote mobility and access for all, such as improving public transportation or making spaces more accessible. This supports the concept of movement and progress within your community.
