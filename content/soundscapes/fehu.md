*The Elder Futhark rune Fehu traditionally symbolizes wealth, abundance, and prosperity.*

To create a meditative background sound that reflects the meanings of Fehu, here are a few suggestions that resonate with its themes:

## Flowing Water

Water is a symbol of life, wealth, and abundance, which is recognized universally. In the context of Fehu, the sound of flowing water, like a stream or river, represents the never-ending flow of riches in our lives, refreshing and cleansing as it moves. This sound may help meditators feel constantly renewed and abundant in their lives.

## Chimes or Bells

The clear and resonant sound of chimes or bells is often associated with clarity, alertness, and spiritual awakening. These sounds are believed to attract positive energy and dispel negativity, making them ideal for meditation themes that focus on prosperity and the welcoming of new opportunities.

## Sounds of Livestock

The gentle sounds of cattle and sheep, with their lowing and bleating, evoke a sense of calmness and simplicity of rural life where wealth was measured by the abundance of one's herd. The serene and repetitive noises of these animals grazing can provide a soothing backdrop for meditation, subtly reinforcing the themes of nurturing, sustenance, and the fundamental earthy aspects of prosperity.

## Rustling Gold or Coins

The sound of coins clinking together is a clear reference to material wealth. This metallic whisper evokes a sense of prosperity and financial gain. It can serve as a reminder of the tangible aspects of abundance, grounding the meditation in the physical realm of wealth.

## Fire Crackling

A crackling fire is a unique and comforting sound associated with warmth, safety, and abundance. It brings up images of happy homes and simpler times, helping you relax and forget your worries. It's a reminder of life's simple pleasures and a source of comfort in times of stress.
